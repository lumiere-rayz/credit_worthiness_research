# credit_worthiness_research
A research doc of a credit worthiness model.

To build a creditworthiness model, you will need to gather data about the individuals or businesses that you want to assess. This data can come from a variety of sources, including credit reports, financial statements, and other public records.

Here are some specific types of data that you may want to consider collecting:

Personal or business identification information: This could include name, date of birth, social security number, business registration number, etc.

Credit history: You will want to gather information about an individual or business's credit history, including their credit score, payment history, and any outstanding debts or liabilities.

Financial information: This could include information about income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.

Employment and income history: This could include information about an individual's employment history, job title, and income.

Demographic information: Depending on the type of creditworthiness model you are building, you may also want to consider collecting demographic information, such as age, gender, and location.

It is important to note that the specific data you need to gather will depend on the type of creditworthiness model you are building and the purpose for which it will be used.
